Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence
that can understand and generate human-like text. They are trained
on vast amounts of text data. LLMs have revolutionized many areas,
including natural language processing, content creation, and search.

Chunking is a critical preprocessing step for LLMs. It involves
breaking down large documents into smaller, more manageable pieces.
Different chunking strategies exist, such as fixed-size, sentence-based,
and semantic chunking.
